# This is a README file! Read me first.

In markdown files, you can make a code block by surrounding your text with triple backticks. For example:

```
This is a multiline
code block that does
not do anything
```

If you want to make an unordered list, use the asterisk for each bulletpoint. For example:

* First item
* Second item
* Third item

On that note, an ordered list is made using the number 1 followed by a period. For example:

1. This item is number 1
2. This item is number 2
3. This item is number 3

This next part gets a little wild.

You can enter inline code by surrounding text with single backticks. For example, `this code is inline and still doesn't do anything` is some inline code.

Bold text tells the user something is important. For example, **WHEN YOUR TEXT EDITOR IS YELLING AT YOU, YOU SHOULD LISTEN UP!!**
