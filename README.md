In markdown files, you can make a code block with triple backticks. For example:

```
This is a multiline
code block that does
not do anything
```

If you want to make a list, use the asterisk for each bulletpoint. For example:

* First item
* Second item
* Third item

On that note, an ordered list is made using the number 1 followed by a period. For example:

1. This item is number 1
2. This item is number 2
3. This item is number 3
